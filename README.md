# Fitness App 

## Goal
* Build a db of exercises

## Getting Started
* Install npm i; npm i next-google-fonts
* **run build with [npm run dev]**
* [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.
* The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Notes
* AWS RDS is only free for the first 20gb per month. MongoDB Atlas offers free database hosting and it's really easy to set up. Mysql doesn't have something like that 12/19/22
* Downloaded MongoDB atlas cli to project
* Added env.local 
* Working on building the Api. Added a data folder testing out how to get a res and req into the app. Check client.data, pages.api.macros, and pages.macros. 

## Deploy on Vercel
